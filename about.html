            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__paragrafo">My name is Júlio César Bernardo Leite, I'm 20 years old. I currently live in Cornélio Procópio in Paraná. I'm studying Software Engineering (4/8), at Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná.</p>
            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__paragrafo">I traveled more than 3000 kilometers in search of knowledge and new experiences. 2 years ago I was living a comfortable life at my parents' house, until I had an epiphany which gave me a thirst for change. Since I was a little boy, I've always liked working with computers, nothing too serious. I disassembled notebooks pretending to know what I was doing, playing programmer without even understanding a line of code. When I finished high school, I found myself under pressure to choose a college. So, as always without really knowing what I was doing, I selected the course that even without me knowing it was always present in my life.</p>
